//Mark:- DESCRIPTION
/*
 1. this property represents two menthods, a setter and a getter, it goes behind the scene, its getting a pointer to NSString object.
 2. ALL OBJECTS IN OBJECTIVE C LIVE IN THE HEAP.
 3. contents is an pointer to NSString object.
 4. setter of a property which is a pointer to an object. We are setting or getting the pointer. So the way this contents thing would point to a string is, someone would call the setter for this thing and set it to as some pointer to a string.
 5. nonatomic means this property is not thread safe.
 6. by default its atomic
 */

/*
 Regular objective C method.
 1. it's public as it's in header file.
 2. retuns Int
 3. takes pointer to another Card as an argument
 4. semantics are it compares itelf to that card and returns 0, if it doesn't match that card and returns some number, that represent how good a match it is otherwise.
